# Documentation Index

This is the authoritative file map for the first-party OpenClaw workspace docs.

If a doc is not listed here as active, do not assume it is canonical. Check the
audit register first.

Anti-drift rule:

- when code or config changes materially, update the appropriate existing
  canonical `.md` file in the same change set and reference the relevant paths
  where useful

Capability-truth rule:

- all declared non-template agents remain in scope for full capability uplift
- do not let current partial runtime truth silently become the documented end
  state
- when agent capability, task promotion, service truth, or operator exposure
  changes, review the full canonical capability pack, not only the single file
  you touched

## Authority Order

Use this order when determining documentation truth:

1. active runtime code and live config
2. canonical anchors (`../OPENCLAW_CONTEXT_ANCHOR.md`, `../README.md`, this index, current KB truth docs)
3. supporting docs and runbooks
4. historical or snapshot docs

If a supporting or historical document conflicts with runtime code, it is not canonical.

## Mandatory Working Sets

Use the smallest relevant pack below before making material changes.

### Agent Capability / Task Promotion

Read in this order:

1. [../OPENCLAW_CONTEXT_ANCHOR.md](../OPENCLAW_CONTEXT_ANCHOR.md)
2. [architecture/AGENT_CAPABILITY_MODEL.md](./architecture/AGENT_CAPABILITY_MODEL.md)
3. [architecture/AGENT_CAPABILITY_IMPLEMENTATION_MATRIX.md](./architecture/AGENT_CAPABILITY_IMPLEMENTATION_MATRIX.md)
4. [architecture/AGENT_ADAPTATION_PLAN.md](./architecture/AGENT_ADAPTATION_PLAN.md) when the work is specifically about adapting proven external role patterns into the current agent set without adding new task lanes
5. [architecture/OPERATOR_SURFACE_CAPABILITY_MATRIX.md](./architecture/OPERATOR_SURFACE_CAPABILITY_MATRIX.md)
6. [reference/task-types.md](./reference/task-types.md)
7. [reference/api.md](./reference/api.md)

Use this pack when:

- promoting tasks into operator-facing profiles
- changing agent readiness or capability claims
- changing `/operator` or `operator-s-console` task exposure
- updating the documented understanding of what OpenClaw has actually built so
  far versus what is still partial

### Operator Surface / UX Wiring

Read in this order:

1. [../OPENCLAW_CONTEXT_ANCHOR.md](../OPENCLAW_CONTEXT_ANCHOR.md)
2. [architecture/OPERATOR_SURFACE_CAPABILITY_MATRIX.md](./architecture/OPERATOR_SURFACE_CAPABILITY_MATRIX.md)
3. [reference/api.md](./reference/api.md)
4. [reference/task-types.md](./reference/task-types.md)
5. [OPERATOR_GUIDE.md](./OPERATOR_GUIDE.md)

Use this pack when:

- wiring new backend routes into `/operator`
- wiring or trimming routes in `operator-s-console`
- deciding whether a route belongs in a private operator surface

## Start And Troubleshooting

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [start/getting-started.md](./start/getting-started.md) | docs-local onboarding |
| [start/quickstart.md](./start/quickstart.md) | short checklist |
| [start/architecture-overview.md](./start/architecture-overview.md) | non-technical overview |
| [troubleshooting/common-issues.md](./troubleshooting/common-issues.md) | common fixes |
| [troubleshooting/debugging.md](./troubleshooting/debugging.md) | deeper debugging |

## Historical Or Snapshot Docs

These are not canonical, but they are still useful as historical evidence:

- [../SPRINT_HARDENING_BASELINE.md](../SPRINT_HARDENING_BASELINE.md)
- [operations/DOCUMENTATION_COMPLETE.md](./operations/DOCUMENTATION_COMPLETE.md)
- [operations/IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md](./operations/IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md)
- [operations/OPERATOR_S_CONSOLE_CUTOVER_BLUEPRINT.md](./operations/OPERATOR_S_CONSOLE_CUTOVER_BLUEPRINT.md)
- [operations/orchestrator_documentation.md](./operations/orchestrator_documentation.md)
- [operations/orchestrator-status.md](./operations/orchestrator-status.md)
- [operations/orchestrator_workflow_plan.md](./operations/orchestrator_workflow_plan.md)
- [operations/PRD_GOVERNANCE_REMEDIATION.md](./operations/PRD_GOVERNANCE_REMEDIATION.md)
- `../orchestrator/docs/hostile-audit/*` should also be treated as historical audit evidence, not current runtime truth.

Retired proof-surface docs were removed from `main`; use Git history if you
need the old milestone ingest or proof-lane runbooks.

## Root Workspace Companions

- [../README.md](../README.md)
- [../QUICKSTART.md](../QUICKSTART.md)
- [../DEPLOYMENT.md](../DEPLOYMENT.md)
- [../OPENCLAW_CONTEXT_ANCHOR.md](../OPENCLAW_CONTEXT_ANCHOR.md)

## Published Docs Site

The published docs site is scaffolded from canonical repo docs, not maintained
as a separate doc tree.

- local dev: `npm run docs:site:dev`
- production build: `npm run docs:site:build`
