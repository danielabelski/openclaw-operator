Last reviewed: 2026-02-28

This is the retained generated operational checklist. The older repetitive
generated KB summaries have been consolidated around `ARCHITECTURE.md`,
`QA_VERIFICATION_MATRIX.md`, and this file.

## Immediate Containment
1. Stop direct agent services not orchestrator-mediated.
2. Keep orchestrator as single active control entry point.
3. Rotate API keys if auth exposure suspected.
4. Validate webhook secret and signature behavior.

## Integrity Recovery
1. Snapshot current state/log artifacts.
2. Reconcile taskHistory with external logs.
3. Rebuild known-good state from last verified checkpoint.

## Policy Recovery
1. Re-run governance integration tests.
2. Re-verify invariants in SYSTEM_INVARIANTS.
3. Block deployment until critical/high findings are remediated.

## Reference Set

Use these documents when executing recovery:

- `../ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `../07_INVARIANTS_AND_RISKS.md`
