# Documentation Audit

Status: Active audit snapshot
Last updated: 2026-03-20
Scope: First-party OpenClaw workspace docs only

## Scope Rules

This audit covers the first-party documentation used to operate and publish this
workspace:

- root workspace Markdown files
- `docs/` content
- selected subproject docs that affect operator truth

This audit does not treat these trees as primary docs for freshness decisions:

- `openclaw-docs/` (mirrored upstream docs)
- `openai-cookbook/` (mirrored upstream docs)
- agent persona files (`agents/*/{SOUL,IDENTITY,USER,TOOLS,...}.md`) unless a
  runtime contract depends on them

Those files may still be needed, but they are not the canonical workspace
operations surface.

## Canonical Docs To Keep Current

These are the documents operators and contributors should treat as active truth:

| Path | Role | Why it stays canonical |
|---|---|---|
| `README.md` | public repo entry | top-level navigation and runtime overview |
| `QUICKSTART.md` | fast-start path | shortest supported local start flow |
| `DEPLOYMENT.md` | deployment surface | root deployment entrypoint |
| `OPENCLAW_CONTEXT_ANCHOR.md` | runtime orientation | canonical repo/runtime truth map |
| `docs/README.md` | docs hub | docs entrypoint |
| `docs/INDEX.md` | docs index | authoritative file map |
| `docs/NAVIGATION.md` | by-role navigation | fast path for operators, contributors, maintainers |
| `docs/SUMMARY.md` | docs status summary | inventory and current status |
| `orchestrator/README.md` | subproject entrypoint | current control-plane orientation for this package |
| `operator-s-console/README.md` | subproject entrypoint | current operator-console orientation for the tracked `/operator` UI |
| `agents/README.md` | subproject entrypoint | current catalog for the agent surface |
| `docs/OPERATOR_GUIDE.md` | day-2 ops | runtime behavior and operating expectations |
| `docs/operations/SPRINT_TO_COMPLETION.md` | active closure plan | current unfinished work tracker |

## Current Technical References To Keep

These remain useful and should stay, but they are secondary to code/config:

| Path | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `docs/concepts/architecture.md` | keep | current high-level technical explanation |
| `docs/guides/configuration.md` | keep | must match `orchestrator_config.json` |
| `docs/guides/running-agents.md` | keep | active operator/developer guide |
| `docs/guides/monitoring.md` | keep | current operational reference |
| `docs/guides/adding-tasks.md` | keep | active extension guide |
| `docs/reference/api.md` | keep | interface reference; code still wins on conflict |
| `docs/reference/task-types.md` | keep | task allowlist reference |
| `docs/reference/state-schema.md` | keep | state shape summary; code is canonical |
| `docs/GOVERNANCE_REPO_HYGIENE.md` | keep | primary policy authority |
| `docs/OPENCLAW_KB/README.md` | keep | classification entrypoint for the KB reference set |
| `docs/OPENCLAW_KB/CLASSIFICATION.md` | keep | per-file current vs historical vs generated register |
| `docs/OPENCLAW_KB/**` | keep | secondary knowledge-pack corpus; verify against code before relying on details |
| `agents/*/README.md` | keep | agent-specific runbooks; subordinate to code and `agent.config.json` |

## Historical Docs To Keep But Demote

These should remain in the repo as historical records, but they should not be
used as active truth:

| Path | Why keep it | Why it is not canonical |
|---|---|---|
| `docs/operations/DOCUMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` | records a past docs build-out milestone | claims completion while docs continued to evolve |
| `docs/operations/IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` | records a past delivery milestone | scope is narrow and no longer reflects full runtime state |
| `docs/operations/orchestrator_documentation.md` | legacy summary of older orchestrator docs | duplicated and drifted from `docs/` |
| `docs/operations/orchestrator-status.md` | dated operational snapshot | tied to 2026-02-19 assumptions |
| `docs/operations/orchestrator_workflow_plan.md` | original workflow planning note | largely superseded by current sprint and code |
| `docs/operations/PRD_GOVERNANCE_REMEDIATION.md` | historical governance gap record | useful as dated evidence, not live truth |
| `docs/operations/OPERATOR_S_CONSOLE_CUTOVER_BLUEPRINT.md` | completed implementation blueprint | useful cutover record, but current `/operator` truth now lives in active runtime docs |

## Historical Docs Removed From Main

These were useful during cutover but are now intentionally removed from the
active repo tree to reduce product-facing ambiguity. Use Git history if they are
ever needed for audit or archaeology.

| Path | Why removed from `main` |
|---|---|
| `docs/operations/MILESTONE_INGEST_CONTRACT.md` | retired proof-lane contract no longer belongs in the active docs tree |
| `docs/operations/MILESTONE_PIPELINE_RUNBOOK.md` | retired proof-lane runbook created more confusion than value in the product repo |
| `orchestrator/MEMORY.md` | synthetic orchestrator-local memory file replaced by the root workspace memory system |
| `orchestrator/README_COMPLETE.md` | stale subproject summary that conflicted with the current operator-first repo truth |
| `orchestrator/PHASE_2_COMPLETION.md` | phase snapshot retained only in Git history |
| `orchestrator/PHASE_3_COMPLETION.md` | phase snapshot retained only in Git history |
| `orchestrator/DOCKER_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` | redundant subproject Docker note superseded by root install docs |
| `orchestrator/docs/API_REFERENCE.md` | stale subproject API layer replaced by `docs/reference/api.md` |
| `orchestrator/docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` | stale subproject deployment layer replaced by `docs/operations/deployment.md` and `DEPLOYMENT.md` |
| `orchestrator/docs/DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT.md` | stale subproject Docker guide replaced by root Docker install docs |
| `orchestrator/docs/LOAD_TEST_REPORT.md` | obsolete load-test artifact not used as current product truth |
| `orchestrator/docs/DOC_UPDATE_WORKFLOW.md` | obsolete subproject doc workflow that kept stale local docs alive |

## Stale Issues Found In This Audit

### Resolved in this change set

1. `docs/INDEX.md`, `docs/NAVIGATION.md`, `docs/README.md`, and
   `docs/SUMMARY.md` pointed to multiple files that do not exist.
2. `docs/reference/state-schema.md` described the wrong state file path and an
   outdated schema.
3. `docs/reference/task-types.md` described only 8 task types, while the code
   allowlist is larger.
4. `docs/guides/configuration.md` referenced a nonexistent configuration
   reference file and used stale path examples.
5. Retired proof-surface docs were easy to mistake for active truth even after
   the orchestrator-owned public proof cutover.
6. `DOCUMENTATION_COMPLETE.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md`,
   `orchestrator_documentation.md`, `orchestrator-status.md`, and
   `orchestrator_workflow_plan.md` were easy to mistake for active truth.
7. `agents/README.md` listed only two agents even though the directory now holds
   a broader agent catalog.
9. `docs/OPENCLAW_KB/README.md` did not clearly state that the KB set is a
   secondary synthesized reference layer rather than the primary runtime
   contract.
10. The individual `agents/*/README.md` files were inconsistent in structure and
    made cross-agent comparison harder than necessary.
11. `docs/OPENCLAW_KB/**` had no per-file status register, so current,
    historical, and generated content was mixed without a clear boundary.
12. Several KB core snapshots had become stale after task allowlisting,
    ToolGate, and SkillAudit moved from planned to implemented.
13. The KB generated layer had unnecessary overlap across architecture,
    control-plane, gateway, lifecycle, and skills summaries.
14. The workspace root had too many documentation-only Markdown files, which
    made the entry surface noisier than necessary.

### Still intentionally not audited in depth

1. some current KB files remain concise snapshots rather than exhaustive
   deep-dive documentation:
   they are current, but intentionally not expanded into full runbooks.
2. agent persona/identity docs:
   these are behavioral and descriptive, not primary runtime contracts.
3. per-agent README depth:
   the agent README layer is now normalized structurally, but not every agent
   has the same implementation maturity behind that shared format.
4. mirrored upstream docs:
   first-party freshness rules do not apply to imported mirrors.

## Root Layout Rule

Keep the workspace root compact:

- root Markdown should be limited to public entrypoints and live workspace
  context/bootstrap files
- topic docs, historical snapshots, and operational references belong under
  `docs/` or a relevant subproject directory
- when an existing doc can absorb a change, update it instead of creating a new
  Markdown file

## Retire vs Keep Rules

### Keep

Keep a document if it does at least one of these:

- it is a current operator entrypoint
- it documents an active interface or contract
- it preserves historical evidence that still has audit value

### Demote

Demote a document to historical when:

- it records a dated milestone or phase
- it claims completion but the repo has moved on
- it duplicates a newer canonical document

### Retire Candidate

A document becomes a retire candidate only when:

- it is not referenced by current navigation
- it adds no historical or audit value
- it is fully superseded by another file

Retire/delete is allowed only when the content has been fully absorbed into an
existing canonical document and navigation has been updated accordingly.

## Remaining Unfinished Work

This is the current work that still appears open after comparing docs to code:

1. Keep the KB classification register current as the runtime evolves so the KB
   does not drift back into mixed-status ambiguity.
2. Keep the compact root-doc rule enforced as future docs evolve.
3. Decide whether `docs/SYSTEM_DIAGRAM_PROMPT.md` should remain a prompt-only
   artifact or gain a generated diagram asset.
4. Continue repo-wide sprint closure from
   `docs/operations/SPRINT_TO_COMPLETION.md`, especially Sprint 9 exposure
   gating and the remaining operational-release checks.
5. Platform-side Devvit review/publish remains outside source control. The app
   can be uploaded and submitted, but Reddit review still gates full publish.
6. Keep `npm run docs:links` green as the lightweight first-party Markdown
   link verification path for root docs, `docs/`, and the main subproject
   READMEs.

## Verification Notes

This audit was based on:

- live code and config under `orchestrator/` and the active workspace docs
- current docs under `docs/`
- a first-party Markdown link check across root docs and `docs/`

Canonical precedence remains:

1. code and config
2. canonical docs listed above
3. historical snapshot docs
