# WORKBOARD

This is the first-read operational tracker for the public `openclaw-operator`
repo.

It is not the canonical runtime spec and it must not compete with code truth,
the canonical anchor, or the architecture/reference docs.

Use it for one thing:

- land quickly on what is done
- what is in flight
- what is next
- what is intentionally parked

Last updated: `2026-07-22`

## Current Headline

The public repo direction is now explicit.

- OpenClaw itself is now the primary front door for daily use through its
  Control UI, chat surfaces, and gateway control plane
- this public repo remains valuable as the specialist orchestrator sidecar:
  bounded lanes, governed evidence, bridgeable operational intelligence, and
  repo-specific runtime truth
- `operator-s-console` remains supported for current orchestrator-specific
  surfaces, but it is no longer the growth center or a competing shell roadmap
- generic shell, dashboard, or parallel-control-UI expansion is now
  intentionally stopped across planning docs and assistant entry points
- current public `main` already includes the capability-closure, bridgeable
  specialist lanes, and legacy-failure fixes needed for that narrower
  direction

## Recently Finished

0. A retained-host portability and migration source-of-truth is now tracked.
   - the manifest records live services, ports, source repositories, plugin and
     skill ownership, pinned runtimes, protected state, and Docker/Redis truth
   - the protected export plan keeps SQLite, Redis, scheduler, memory, social
     state, credentials, browser authentication, and encryption keys outside
     Git and requires service-consistent export
   - the bootstrap check fails closed while active local-only source remains
     unpublished, instead of pretending a partial clone is reproducible
   - the active Gateway stabilization repair and the validated-but-unactivated
     Codex exact-toolsAllow repair are preserved as separate patch artifacts
   - no service, scheduler, runtime database, plugin installation, credential,
     or external system was changed by this audit

0. Queue admission and telemetry integrity hardening is implemented and active
   on the retained host.
   - one central admission decision now precedes accepted/queued telemetry
   - terminal and in-flight idempotency-key reuse is reported as
     `duplicate-suppressed` without creating phantom execution attempts
   - deliberate same-key retry requires matching persisted recovery evidence
     and receives a distinct durable queue-attempt identity
   - document-repair admission rechecks active/cooldown state inside its shared
     lock, and concurrent proof admits only one repair
   - operator API and run detail now expose admission/attempt truth
   - the condition-gated activation completed at `2026-07-17 02:45:49 BST`
     after the SQLite rollback-window checks passed
   - exactly one approved `orchestrator.service` restart activated the frozen
     candidate; post-activation service, SQLite, Redis, OpenAPI, operator UI,
     task-audit, and loopback-binding checks passed
   - the preserved historical failure evidence was not replayed, retried,
     cleared, or rewritten

0. The retained host orchestrator completed its normalized SQLite v2 cutover.
   - the frozen Mongo source was migrated with collection counts and checksums verified twice
   - all 47,097 item-normalized state records, 28 top-level sections, and the lossless Mongo source archive were retained
   - the service recovered once on SQLite; public persistence health reports `store: sqlite` with Redis coordination healthy
   - Mongo remains unchanged as rollback evidence for at least 24 hours and until explicit retirement approval
   - concurrency remains 1/1/1 because the active queue is empty and recent memory pressure does not justify an increase

0. The expanded Tail Wagging business registry is now the canonical control-plane source.
   - schema v2.0.1 preserves the full 12-case live pipeline while adding 29 KPIs, 7 strategic initiatives, 12 business risks, and 15 explicit coverage gaps
   - the business planner now normalizes expanded outcomes and can turn strategic initiatives plus critical coverage gaps into bounded internal planning candidates
   - canonical runtime path remains `business/registry.json`, so the running scheduler can load the expansion on its next cycle without a service restart
   - internal briefs and evidence plans are safe-autonomous; outreach, publishing, deployments, private data, secrets, pricing commitments, and other external or binding actions remain approval-gated

0. The governed business-value loop now covers a broader daily opportunity set.
   - discovery includes founder and vibe-coded product rescue readiness plus community-value and social-growth opportunities
   - safe market-research candidates can enter the daily cycle while public, social, and Gmail actions remain approval-gated
   - completed cycle snapshots are retained as reviewable business-value evidence

0. Autonomous Work Controller v1.1 runtime hardening is implemented.
   - approved queue, paused-task, standing-order, workboard, schedule, operator, and capability-gap intake is prioritized and deduplicated
   - the existing provider guard bridges sanitized pause/resume state into durable controller checkpoints
   - incompatible restored model context is blocked before continuation and reserve-threshold compaction checkpoints first
   - small/local models lose unsafe web and runtime tools while ToolGate-governed structured read-only tools remain eligible
   - Telegram targeting uses only an opaque current inbound-session alias

0. Autonomous Work Controller v1 is implemented as a bounded orchestrator lane.
   - approved operator work is normalized into structural lane/risk decisions
   - coding audits route through ToolGate to coding-agent-skills first
   - safe read-only continuation is checkpointed and loop-bounded
   - invocation evidence and deduplicated capability gaps are durable
   - existing queue, approvals, registry, persistence, and scheduling remain authoritative

0. Authenticated specialist-console rendering was repaired.
   - `/operator/business-value` and `/operator/knowledge` no longer render the
     normalization layer's raw diagnostic objects as React children
   - raw payload evidence remains available as non-enumerable `__raw` metadata
   - shared API error rendering and an operator-route error boundary now keep
     unexpected response drift from blanking the entire console
   - installed OpenClaw UI extension surfaces were audited; `/orch` remains the
     supported integration path because no plugin-owned route/navigation mount
     is currently exposed by the installed Control UI

1. Public onboarding path was hardened.
   - local-first dev now boots without requiring Mongo/Redis first
   - docs and docs site were aligned to that path

2. Docs-site publication was curated.
   - only allowlisted public docs now publish to GitHub Pages
   - stale/internal docs stopped leaking into the public docs site

3. Current agent portfolio capability closure landed.
   - all declared non-template public agents now have bounded runtime evidence,
     truthful operator exposure, and closed capability gaps for the current
     runtime slice

4. Legacy spawned-agent failure handling was fixed.
   - structured worker results are now preserved even when the child exits
     non-zero after writing a result file
   - this closed the last Wave 4 integration regression and kept run-detail
     summaries truthful

5. Protected-branch verification was tightened.
   - pushes to `main` / `master` now run a repo-managed pre-push `verify:main`
     gate locally
   - GitHub validation now runs the same protected-branch contract
   - production-artifact and docs-site workflows no longer chain automatically
     from successful validation; both require explicit manual dispatch
   - both publish-style workflows run `verify:main` themselves and bind their
     mutating job to the named `production` or `github-pages` environment
   - required reviewers remain a GitHub repository-settings control; the
     workflow declarations do not silently claim that platform policy exists

6. An uncommitted governance spike was intentionally dropped.
   - retained ideas only: dynamic task validation, auth-grace config, route
     inventory, and manifest-boundary concepts
   - dropped implementation because it duplicated the shipped
     `/api/companion/*` surface, targeted stale runtime types/helpers, and
     shipped a self-invalidating route-governance registry
   - future governance work should restart from current `main`, not from the
     discarded local spike

7. The Wave 4 runtime-readiness test was hardened again.
   - the first fix closed early-read races but still left the suite vulnerable
     to cached reads, stale local agent service-state memory, and critical
     incident bleed from earlier failure tests
   - the current test now isolates Wave 4 behind a seeded runtime reset,
     disables retry noise for intentional failure cases, and requires current
     run/task ids when checking promoted runtime evidence
   - assistant workflow guidance now explicitly requires cache-aware real
     completion conditions and isolation from ambient host artifacts for
     integration tests

8. The first new-agent adoption contract is now implemented in repo code.
   - `deployment-ops-agent` now exists as a worker-first, read-only
     deployment posture lane rather than a deploy executor
   - the public runtime, operator UI, task catalog, run-detail deck, and
     integration proof now all include `deployment-ops`
   - the lane sits between `release-readiness` and the approval-gated
     `agent-deploy` mutator without absorbing deploy authority

9. `deployment-ops` is now live-confirmed on the running operator surface.
   - a focused live canary succeeded on `3312` on `2026-04-10`
   - `/api/agents/overview` promoted current-run `deploymentOps` runtime
     evidence for `deployment-ops-agent`
   - `/api/tasks/catalog` and `/api/companion/catalog` now vary their
     protected cache key on the live operator task profile set, which closes
     the stale-post-restart catalog gap that initially hid the new lane

10. The `code-index-agent` contract pass is now complete.
   - the bounded lane is now defined from current repo indexing, knowledge, and
     operator-surface code truth
   - the first slice is explicitly worker-first, read-only, and local-first
   - the contract keeps Codex-like repo intelligence inside the current
     manifest and ToolGate model instead of flattening governance into broad
     unrestricted authority

11. `code-index` is now implemented and live-confirmed on the running operator
    surface.
   - a focused live canary succeeded on `3312` on `2026-04-10`
   - `/api/agents/overview` promoted current-run `codeIndex` runtime evidence
     for `code-index-agent`
   - `/operator/agents` served the same live runtime slice cleanly during the
     canary

12. `test-intelligence` is now implemented and live-confirmed on the running
    operator surface.
   - a focused live canary succeeded on `3312` on `2026-04-12`
   - the live task catalog exposed `test-intelligence` as a confirmed-working
     bounded lane
   - `/api/agents/overview` promoted current-run `testIntelligence` runtime
     evidence for `test-intelligence-agent`
   - the live run detail carried bounded `testIntelligence`, `suiteCoverage`,
     `recentFailures`, `flakySignals`, `releaseRisk`, and `evidenceWindow`
     output for the canary run

13. Repo direction is now aligned around the OpenClaw front door.
   - upstream OpenClaw now clearly owns the generic gateway/control-UI,
     approvals, and task-board direction
   - this repo is no longer treating a parallel shell as the default product
     roadmap
   - first-read docs and assistant entry points should now treat
     `operator-s-console` as a maintained specialist surface only

14. Active onboarding and navigation docs now match that repo direction.
   - quickstarts, getting-started guidance, running-agents guidance, and
     navigation/reference docs now point users toward OpenClaw plus `/orch`
     for daily use
   - `/operator` remains documented honestly as the repo-native specialist
     console for deeper orchestrator work
   - active docs now stop implying that a generic shell is still the default
     growth path

15. The first shell keep-and-deepen slice now targets closure, not shell breadth.
   - run detail now carries an operator follow-through rail for the next
     specialist surface to open after a run finishes or blocks
   - the shell is being deepened where OpenClaw is thinnest for this repo:
     approval gates, incident closure, knowledge freshness, governance review,
     live health comparison, and owning-agent readiness
   - this keeps `operator-s-console` focused on specialist closure work rather
     than reopening a generic dashboard roadmap

16. The next shell keep-and-deepen slice now resolves exact run handoff targets.
   - run detail now resolves linked approval and incident handoff context from
     live approval and incident data instead of only pointing operators toward a
     generic queue
   - follow-through routes now preserve run/task context into approvals and
     incidents so operators land on the exact closure object already linked to
     the run when that linkage exists
   - approvals and incidents now honor run-handoff focus in-page, keeping the
     shell deep on specialist closure detail instead of broadening the shell
     surface

## Current Recommended Next Move

Close the migration source blockers before exporting protected state:

- reconcile the root operations workspace into small source-only commits and a
  reachable intended remote, without sweeping in generated docs or private
  evidence
- reconcile the social-agent source separately
- give the active public-decision-intelligence service an authoritative repo
  and reconcile the active evidence-console source with its remote
- pin or source-control the active personal HyperFrames/media skill bundle
- rerun `scripts/bootstrap-machine.sh --check`; only after its source gate is
  green should a separately approved protected runtime export be created

Do not execute the protected export or claim full-machine reproducibility while
any active source component exists only in an installed package, dirty tree,
untracked incubation directory, or running process.

The immediate business-registry integrity gate is closed:

- the pre-expansion fingerprint compatibility fix was activated and verified
  by the approved 09:21 BST restart on 15 July; no further restart is needed
- the later normalized SQLite cutover recovery remained healthy with the fix
  loaded
- the separate read-only audit of the 732 executions reconciled during the
  08:10 BST startup is complete: 731 were stale `doc-change` work and one was
  `drift-repair`; all remain internally consistent terminal evidence
- do not replay, retry, clear, or rewrite that batch; later successful
  doc-change and drift-repair runs plus an empty current doc-change backlog
  remove the basis for replay
- preserve the historical queue-telemetry inconsistency as evidence: the
  failed drift-repair run received two later queue-only event pairs but never
  executed or reached a terminal result; the source hardening is now
  implemented and tested locally without replaying or rewriting that history

The SQLite rollback-window and queue-admission activation gates are now closed:

- the post-window verification completed on 17 July with SQLite integrity
  `ok`, zero foreign-key violations, WAL active, and all 28 sections plus
  47,097 normalized array items retained
- the activation job completed and removed its one-shot schedule; repeated
  post-activation checks found the service healthy with SQLite and Redis
  healthy, loopback-only exposure, and no new task-audit or warning findings
- Mongo remains unchanged as rollback evidence and retirement is still a
  separate explicit approval boundary
- retain 1/1/1 concurrency until real queue and memory evidence supports a
  separate reviewed change
- an authenticated live duplicate-trigger proof would create task state and
  remains separately approval-gated; the automated contract and integration
  proofs already cover duplicate suppression without requiring that live write

Reconcile the activated candidate as one reviewable change set:

- keep the SQLite cutover, startup-reconciliation audit, queue-admission
  hardening, API/operator truth, tests, and activation evidence aligned
- preserve generated OpenAPI and operator assets only when their source
  generators and focused contract tests agree
- prepare an evidence-backed commit packet after the full local validation
  gate; committing, pushing, releasing, or deploying remains a separate
  approval boundary

Stabilize the OpenClaw-front-door cutover in normal use:

- use OpenClaw plus the orchestrator bridge as the normal daily path and prove
  it in routine usage
- keep watching for shell-first planning drift before opening another growth
  slice
- keep `operator-s-console` maintenance-only unless a change directly supports
  a unique orchestrator lane not already covered by OpenClaw

Current implementation target:

1. use OpenClaw Control UI/chat plus `/orch` bridge flows as the default human
   workflow
2. keep `/operator` and `operator-s-console` focused on unique
   orchestrator-specific evidence and workflows, not generic shell growth
3. prove the bridge-led path is enough for normal operation before widening the
   local specialist surface again
4. only after the cutover is stable reopen another bounded specialist-lane
   build slice

## Intentionally Parked

These are real work items, but they are not the immediate next build slice.

1. Generic shell growth or `operator-s-console` expansion beyond current
   specialist surfaces.
   - no new generic dashboards, shell redesigns, or front-door polish meant to
     compete with OpenClaw Control UI
   - keep shell work limited to maintenance or unique orchestrator-specific
     specialist workflows

2. Broader external-catalog agent growth beyond the current proven specialist
   lanes.
   - one candidate at a time only
   - do not reopen this until the OpenClaw-front-door cutover is fully
     reflected in repo guidance and normal use

3. Further usage-refinement polish.
   - better queue-style triage surfaces
   - more ledger-level next-action and freshness guidance

4. Coordination scale-out beyond the current bounded Redis / Valkey slice.

5. Ongoing docs-truth maintenance and navigation hygiene.

6. Host-specific lifecycle expansion for additional resident services.
   - only if a host genuinely needs them

7. Optional maintenance-visibility follow-up from retired branch archaeology.
   - the old `feat/heartbeat-maintenance-cutover` branch was not kept as a
     merge target
   - if revisited, re-implement only from current `main`
   - preserve these ideas, not the branch shape:
     - maintenance cadence records behind the internal heartbeat scheduler
     - operator overview maintenance card
     - optional diagnostic toggle for internal maintenance runs
   - do not merge the old branch wholesale because later runtime, onboarding,
     capability, and docs-site work already superseded most of it

## Hard Rules

1. Do not treat prose from external role catalogs as shipped capability.
2. Do not bulk-import external agents.
3. Do not widen tool or network boundaries just to make a new agent possible.
4. Productize one bounded agent at a time with:
   - lane
   - governed access
   - operator evidence
   - tests
   - docs
