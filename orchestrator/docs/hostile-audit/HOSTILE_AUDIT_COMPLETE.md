## Test Suite Truth

**Claimed:** 102 tests, 77-93% passing  
**Actual:** 56 tests, 59% passing (33/56 ✅)

### Breakdown by Test File:

| Test File | Total | Passing | Failing | %Pass |
|-----------|-------|---------|---------|-------|
| integration.test.ts | 14 | 14 | 0 | 100% ✅ |
| agents-bootup.test.ts | 14 | 13 | 1 | 93% |
| audit-trail.test.ts | 15 | 7 | 8 | 47% |

## Final Verdict

**Claim:** "Production-ready and fully operational"

**Auditor Verdict:** 🔴 **FALSE - DO NOT DEPLOY**

### Why:

1. **7 CRITICAL security vulnerabilities** prevent deployment
2. **100% data loss** on container restart (KB)
3. **59% test pass rate** (not production-quality)
4. **Zero graceful shutdown** (state inconsistency risk)
5. **No rate limiting** (DoS vulnerability)

### Severity Assessment:

- **Week 1 Attack Probability:** HIGH - Hardcoded credentials + no auth = trivial compromise
- **Month 1 Operational Failure:** HIGH - KB data loss + resource leaks + no cleanup
- **Customer Impact if Deployed:** CRITICAL - Data loss, service unavailability, security incident

### Recommendation:

**DO NOT DEPLOY** until:
1. All 20 blockers from audit resolved
2. Test pass rate: 100% (currently 59%)
3. Security team sign-off: REQUIRED
4. 15-day hardening sprint completed
5. Load test: Verified at 100 req/sec

### Go-Live Date:

**PROPOSED:** 3 weeks from audit start (2026-03-10, if team starts immediately)
