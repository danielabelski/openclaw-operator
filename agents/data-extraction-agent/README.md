# Document & Data Extraction Agent

Status: Active task runbook
Primary orchestrator task: `data-extraction`
Canonical contract: `agent.config.json` and `src/index.ts`

## Mission
Convert local document inputs into provenance-backed extraction packages with confidence and normalization-handoff guidance.

This agent now also handles notebook files (`.ipynb`) and media/reference
assets by extracting structured metadata rather than treating them as opaque
blobs. That keeps cookbook examples and support artifacts useful to the rest of
the system even when the raw files are binary.

## Contract

### Inputs
- `data-extraction` tasks.
- Files from `workspace`.

### Outputs
- Structured records in `artifacts/extracted`.
- Shared specialist output fields:
  - `operatorSummary`
  - `recommendedNextActions`
  - `specialistContract`

### File Path Scope
- Reads: `workspace`
- Writes: `artifacts/extracted`

## Runtime

- Local entrypoint: `npm start`
- Alternate development loop: `npm run dev`
- Current test surface: `npm test` (placeholder until richer tests are added)

## Governance
- `ROLE.md`
- `SCOPE.md`
- `POLICY.md`
- `TOOLS.md`
- `../../docs/GOVERNANCE_REPO_HYGIENE.md`
