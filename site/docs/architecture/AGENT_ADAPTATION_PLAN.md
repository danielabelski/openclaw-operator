# Agent Adaptation Plan

This document defines the current adaptation plan for improving the existing
OpenClaw Operator agents by borrowing the strongest role, workflow, and
deliverable patterns from the external
[`msitarzewski/agency-agents`](https://github.com/msitarzewski/agency-agents)
repository.

This is an adaptation plan, not an architectural inversion plan.

The current runtime model remains:

- OpenClaw gateway/runtime as ingress and channel companion
- orchestrator as the execution and governance authority
- current task lanes, API contracts, approval boundaries, and operator truth as
  the controlling product contract

## Hard Scope For This Plan

This plan is intentionally narrow.

In scope:

- improving the existing 13 declared non-template agents
- strengthening role intelligence, workflow clarity, refusal quality,
  deliverable framing, and operator-facing output usefulness
- adapting wording, structure, and reasoning patterns from strong external
  agent specs into the current agent portfolio

Out of scope:

- adding new task lanes
- replacing orchestrator with OpenClaw-native agent dispatch
- flattening ToolGate, skill allowlists, or governance boundaries
- importing the external repository as a runtime architecture template
- adding broad new operator pages solely for the adaptation pass

New task lanes are future work and should only start after this plan is agreed
on and implemented.

## Why Adapt Instead Of Copy

`agency-agents` is strong at:

- specialist role definition
- workflow and deliverable clarity
- persona and communication discipline
- explicit "when to use this agent" framing

This workspace is strong at:

- orchestration
- approvals
- run history
- incidents
- readiness and proof
- governed skills and runtime evidence

The right move is therefore:

- borrow role and workflow patterns
- keep the current orchestrator architecture
- make existing agents feel more expert, more explicit, and more useful inside
  the current operator product

## Cross-Cutting Adaptation Rules

Every adaptation slice should improve one or more of these without changing the
task lane identity:

1. clearer role boundaries and refusal rules
2. stronger internal workflow stages
3. better deliverable contracts and output summaries
4. sharper operator-facing "what happened / what to do next" language
5. more explicit evidence and verification posture
6. stronger specialist voice without turning the agent into roleplay noise

Do not adapt:

- ornamental personality for its own sake
- broad capabilities that require new tools or permissions without explicit
  governance work
- external-repo architecture assumptions that conflict with the current queue,
  approval, incident, or proof model

## Implementation Pattern To Reuse Across Agents

Each adaptation should land through the same four-layer pattern:

1. agent spec uplift
2. runtime output uplift
3. operator wording uplift
4. proof uplift

### 1. Agent Spec Uplift

Update the local agent contract files first:

- `README.md`
- `ROLE.md`
- `SCOPE.md`
- `POLICY.md`
- `SOUL.md` or equivalent local identity file where present

Target shape:

- mission
- what this agent owns
- what it must refuse or delegate
- standard workflow stages
- deliverables
- failure modes
- success criteria

### 2. Runtime Output Uplift

Update the agent result payload and handler summary logic so operator-visible
output becomes more useful.

Target additions by lane:

- clearer summary blocks
- explicit recommended next actions
- confidence/evidence wording that reflects real proof
- audience-specific result shaping where already appropriate for the task

### 3. Operator Wording Uplift

Only update operator copy where the underlying output truth is already real.

Likely touch points:

- task descriptions
- run detail summaries
- approval context copy
- incident remediation context
- agent overview notes

### 4. Proof Uplift

Each adaptation slice must be proven in the current architecture:

- focused unit/runtime tests
- integration tests where readiness or operator contract changes
- live canary only when it strengthens runtime truth materially

## Immediate Implementation Order

The implementation order below is the current recommended sequence.

### Phase 0: Shared Adaptation Contract

Goal:

- standardize the adaptation shape before touching individual agents

Work:

- define a common specialist-agent contract template for current agents
- define standard result-summary fields for operator usefulness
- define standard refusal-language expectations
- define standard "next action" language for operators

Phase 0 contract fields:

- `operatorSummary`
- `recommendedNextActions[]`
- `specialistContract.{role, workflowStage, deliverable, status, refusalReason, escalationReason}`

Shared status vocabulary:

- `completed`
- `watching`
- `blocked`
- `escalate`
- `refused`

Acceptance:

- plan approved
- common adaptation checklist documented
- no task-lane expansion introduced

### Phase 1: Core Trust And Workflow Agents

Agents:

- `integration-agent`
- `qa-verification-agent`
- `security-agent`
- `system-monitor-agent`

Why first:

- these agents define the system's credibility
- they shape runs, incidents, approvals, and operator trust
- improvements here raise the value of the whole control plane

Primary borrow targets:

- Workflow Architect
- Agents Orchestrator
- Reality Checker
- Security Engineer
- SRE
- Incident Response Commander

Acceptance:

- stronger result summaries and recommended actions
- clearer refusal and escalation language
- readiness and operator truth remain aligned
- focused tests plus at least one relevant live proof refresh where justified

### Phase 2: Communication And Knowledge Agents

Agents:

- `doc-specialist`
- `content-agent`
- `summarization-agent`
- `reddit-helper`

Why second:

- these agents shape what operators and external readers actually consume
- better framing here makes the system feel more expert immediately

Primary borrow targets:

- Technical Writer
- Content Creator
- Executive Summary Generator
- Reddit Community Builder
- ZK Steward

Acceptance:

- clearer deliverable structures
- stronger audience targeting
- more readable handoff/report outputs
- unchanged task identities and approval model

### Phase 3: Code, Research, And Data Agents

Agents:

- `build-refactor-agent`
- `market-research-agent`
- `data-extraction-agent`
- `normalization-agent`
- `skill-audit-agent`

Why third:

- these lanes benefit from the adaptation work but are downstream of the core
  trust and communication upgrades
- they also need their wording kept tightly aligned to real tool/governance
  truth

Primary borrow targets:

- Frontend Developer
- Backend Architect
- Code Reviewer
- Trend Researcher
- AI Citation Strategist
- Email Intelligence Engineer
- Data Consolidation Agent
- MCP Builder

Acceptance:

- better scope/risk narration
- stronger structured deliverables
- clearer normalization and research handoff output
- no overstatement beyond current tool and network boundaries

## Per-Agent First Slices

### `integration-agent`

First slices:

- rewrite local role/workflow docs around conductor stages
- add clearer workflow outcome blocks: `what ran`, `what blocked`, `what to do next`
- strengthen delegated-step rationale in result summaries
- ensure run detail and readiness wording reflect the richer workflow story

### `qa-verification-agent`

First slices:

- strengthen certification/refusal contract in local docs

### `security-agent`

First slices:

- rewrite local docs around threat posture, regression review, and bounded fixes
- improve finding/risk narrative in results and highlights
- strengthen remediation and closure wording for operators
- keep claims bounded to current local/runtime inspection surfaces

### `system-monitor-agent`

First slices:

- rewrite local docs around diagnosis, reliability posture, and operator action
- improve summary language for incidents, pressure, and next actions
- shape results more clearly for "watching", "degraded", and "action required"

### `summarization-agent`

First slices:

- define summary modes by operator need: quick read, action summary, handoff
- improve what gets preserved versus compressed
- standardize downstream-ready summary sections
- ensure result summaries expose what context was intentionally retained

### `reddit-helper`

First slices:

- strengthen local docs around authenticity, value, and community trust
- improve draft rationale and "why this reply is safe/helpful" output
- standardize explanation of fallback vs provider-polished posture
- keep subreddit-culture heuristics grounded and not overconfident

### `build-refactor-agent`

First slices:

- tighten pre-edit reasoning and refusal language
- improve change-plan, risk, and rollback narration
- improve verification summary readability for operators
- keep all claims strictly aligned to bounded patch and verification truth

### `market-research-agent`

First slices:

- improve source-plan and signal classification language
- define clearer output sections for findings, confidence, and delta capture
- strengthen explanation of degraded-but-actionable fetch results
- preserve current allowlisted-fetch boundary

### `data-extraction-agent`

First slices:

- improve extraction deliverable shape and schema/provenance language
- standardize confidence and normalization-handoff sections
- improve explanation of parser limitations without flattening value
- keep format truth aligned with current parser support

### `normalization-agent`

First slices:

- sharpen canonical-schema and uncertainty language
- improve comparison-ready output formatting
- standardize normalization summaries for operators and downstream agents
- preserve current governed access and schema boundaries

### `skill-audit-agent`

First slices:

- improve governance checklist and review posture wording
- tighten tool-interface and provenance quality language
- standardize operator-facing audit deliverables
- keep all approval and trust posture claims aligned to current runtime truth

## Acceptance Gate For Each Agent

No agent adaptation slice is done until all of the following are true:

1. local agent docs reflect the new specialist contract
2. runtime result summaries or highlights reflect the improved deliverable
   shape where relevant
3. operator-facing wording stays honest about what the lane can actually do
4. focused tests pass
5. if readiness/runtime truth changes materially, the canonical capability docs
   are updated in the same change set

## Explicit Future Work Boundary

Future work may include:

- new task lanes
- broader role portfolio growth
- OpenClaw-side richer companion-plugin metadata
- tighter channel/runtime integration

Do not start any of that work under the label of this adaptation plan.

This plan is complete only when the current 13-agent portfolio has been
upgraded in-role without changing the current architecture.
